Bangladesh is an agricultural country where 87 percent of rural households rely on agriculture for at least part of their income. 
But the agriculture of our country still lags behind. 
Because in our country farmers are not aware of the intelligent technologies much compared to farmers of other countries. 
As a result, if they face any kind of problem, they do not understand what to do or where to go. Sometimes they have to go a long distance to consult. 
At the same time, the farmers do not get the proper money for their products as per the original market price. As our country is getting digital and it is the manifesto of the present government to make a digital country, 
we wanted to make a web application for the farmers as smart devices are very much available now in the rural areas also. 
This web application might be a one-stop digital solution for farming problems.</p><br><br><br><br>

<p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">
In our country, if farmers face any kinds of problems regarding their crops, they do not understand where to contact. Our project will help them to contact agriculturists or veterinary specialists. Sometimes farmers need money to cultivate but they find it difficult to manage it. Even if they can hardly manage loans, they have to pay a huge amount of interest. Our project will help them to take loans and microcredits with a negligible amount of interest. Usually, the farmers sell their products to wholesalers and they sell them to the consumers. As a result, sometimes it is seen that farmers are not getting the proper price as the market price. Even the customers also want farm-fresh food which they sometimes may not get in this process. Our project will allow the customers to buy products directly from the farmers so that the farmers get proper money and the buyers get fresh food.
